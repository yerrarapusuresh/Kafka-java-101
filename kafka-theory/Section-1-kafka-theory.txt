Section -> Kafka Basics:

====== Understanding of Topic =====
* Topics: a particular stream of data.
    - similar to table in database(witout constraints). 
    - you can create as many as you want topics, there is no limit.
    - topics Identified by its name.

* Topics are split into partitions
    - each partition is ordered.
    - each message within a partition gets incremental id, called offset.
    e.g. topic1
    partition1: 0 1 2 3 4 5 
    partition2: 0 1 2 3

    - real time example like fleet of truks(any courier companies). assume a topic like truck-tracker.
      each partition is like tracking for each truck on intervel of 20 secs. so that they can collect empl.
      information such as how many kilometers they traveled so far, fuel they used, if they need rest we can
      send notification and so on

    - order is garunted within the partition (not accros the partitions).
    - data is kept only for limited time.(not more than one week).
    - once data is assigned to partition it is cant change. immutable.
    - each message is assigned randomly unless mentioned key
